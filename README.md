# CSS Only Dark/Light Theme

A simple webpage tutorial for a CSS only dark/light theme solution.

Without adding a reset or styles, this is css that makes it work `color-scheme` and `prefers-color-scheme`, and together:

```css
@media (prefers-color-scheme: light) {
  html {
    color-scheme: light;
  }
}

@media (prefers-color-scheme: dark) {
  html {
    color-scheme: dark;
  }
}
```

Will build on this project for the next totorial with a toggle switch and JavaScript to come soon...
